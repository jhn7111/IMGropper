# IMGropper

A image cropping gui application.

Programs that help you crop multiple images to the desired parts with the same resolution.

It only works in jpeg format. (I have plans to add other formats. Somedays...)

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.

```python
pip install -r requirement.txt #install required lib
python setup.py build #build to win32
```

## Usage

work resolution: The size of the main window you will use for your work.

output resoultion: A image you will get at the end.

work dir: Folder with images that need to be worked on.

Mouse left: Save an image.

Mouse right: To next image

Mouse wheel: Change the size of the cropping rectangle.

Worked images will saved "work_dir\worked"

## ISSUE
I only tested on Windows11.
